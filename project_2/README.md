<h1>Etch-a-Sketch PCB:</h1>
<p>This project used a PocketBeagle and an SPI screen to create a simple digital Etch-a-Sketch project!</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>
<p> This project utilizes an SPI screen to enable the use of colors when drawing. Two potentiometers\n
are used to draw on the screen. To change colors, a button on the back of the board can be pressed to cycle
between red, green, and blue. The device can be turned on or off by pressing the power button on the \n
back of the board. The project can easily be expanded by using the included USB port.</p>
<h2>Documentation:</h2>
<p>To build the PCB, refer to the docs folder in this repository. The schematics show how to wire and assemble the board. Manufacturer information can be found under the MFG folder.</p>
